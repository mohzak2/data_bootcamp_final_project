I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description:

Black Obesity Rates in America Explained: Exploring Black obesity in America as a product of social and economic dynamics, through graphic
vizualizations
While we see the statistics, we don't split them by state. When we split them by state, we don't split them by race. When we split them by race, we don't split them by a social factor. When we split them by a social factor, we don't split them by an economic factor. I think you get the point.. there is always a story behind the numbers one sees at the surface. One set of statistics is always influenced by another set of statistics.
In this project, I aim to visually display the proportionality in being black and being obese in states around the country. I aim to do this by comparing black state obesity rates to white state obesity rates, white state obesity rates to average state obesity rates. Then, I will split Black state obesity rates and White state obesity rates by factors such that disproportionately harm Black people such as population, income inequality and incarceration rates.
